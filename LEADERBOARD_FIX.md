# Leaderboard Database Fix

## Problem

The leaderboard is showing "Error Loading Leaderboard" because of Row Level Security (RLS) policies that prevent users from accessing other users' data.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Less Secure)

Run the `fix_leaderboard_rls.sql` script in your Supabase SQL editor to allow public read access to exam results and profiles.

**⚠️ Warning**: This makes all exam results and profile data publicly readable.

### Option 2: Secure Fix (Recommended)

Run the `secure_leaderboard_setup.sql` script in your Supabase SQL editor. This creates:

1. **Database Views**: `leaderboard_data` and `leaderboard_stats` that only expose necessary information
2. **Database Function**: `get_leaderboard_data()` that returns aggregated leaderboard data
3. **Public Access**: Grants read access only to the views and function, not the raw tables

## Steps to Fix

### Step 1: Choose Your Approach

- **For quick testing**: Use Option 1
- **For production**: Use Option 2

### Step 2: Run the SQL Script

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the chosen SQL script
4. Click "Run" to execute

### Step 3: Test the Leaderboard

1. Go to your leaderboard page
2. The error should be resolved
3. You should see real data from your database

## What the Fix Does

### Option 1 (Quick Fix)

- Removes restrictive RLS policies
- Allows public read access to `exam_results` and `profiles` tables
- Enables leaderboard to fetch all user data

### Option 2 (Secure Fix)

- Creates secure database views that only expose necessary data
- Creates a database function for leaderboard data
- Maintains RLS security on original tables
- Only exposes: username, email, scores, exam counts, certifications

## Database Schema Requirements

Make sure your database has these tables:

- `exam_results` - Contains exam scores and results
- `profiles` - Contains user profile information

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get errors:

1. Check that the SQL script ran successfully
2. Verify your database has the required tables
3. Check the browser console for specific error messages
4. Ensure your Supabase connection is working

### If no data appears:

1. Make sure you have exam results in your database
2. Check that users have taken exams
3. Verify the data structure matches the expected format

## Security Considerations

- **Option 1**: Exposes all user data publicly
- **Option 2**: Only exposes leaderboard-relevant data
- **Recommendation**: Use Option 2 for production environments

## Testing

After applying the fix:

1. Take some exams to generate data
2. Check that the leaderboard displays real user rankings
3. Verify that search and filtering work
4. Test the refresh functionality
